# Unity WebRTC Streaming and Signaling Server

This project implements a fully Unity-based WebRTC solution for streaming camera video, exchanging data messages, and managing WebRTC signaling without requiring external Node.js or browser-based infrastructure. It uses Unity's built-in WebRTC API and the `WebSocketSharp` library for signaling.

---

## Features

* Unity **camera stream capture** using `VideoStreamTrack`
* Unity-only **WebRTC signaling server** using `WebSocketSharp`
* **Data channel messaging** with buffering support before channel is open
* **ICE candidate and SDP exchange**
* Compatible with STUN (`stun:stun.l.google.com:19302`)
* No external servers required â€“ everything runs inside Unity

## Project Structure

| Script                        | Purpose                                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CameraStreamer.cs`           | Captures the Unity camera as a `VideoStreamTrack` for WebRTC                    |
| `WebRtcServerManager.cs`      | Manages the `RTCPeerConnection`, handles offers/answers, ICE, and data channels |
| `WebRtcMessage.cs`            | Represents signaling messages (SDP, ICE, or custom data)                        |
| `WebSocketSignalingServer.cs` | Runs a WebSocket server and handles signaling messages inside Unity             |
| `MainThreadDispatcher.cs`     | Ensures Unity coroutines run on the main thread from WebSocketSharp callbacks   |
| `SendButtonHandler.cs`        | Triggers sending messages over WebRTC from a Unity input action                 |

## How It Works

1. Unity starts a WebSocket server at `ws://<device-ip>:8080/ws`
2. A remote WebRTC peer (client app) connects and sends an SDP **offer**
3. The Unity app:

   * Sets the remote description
   * Adds a video track from the Unity camera
   * Sends an **SDP answer**
4. ICE candidates are exchanged
5. A **data channel** is established for sending/receiving messages
6. Unity can send messages using `SendMessageBuffered()`

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

* Unity 2022+ (with Unity.WebRTC installed via Package Manager)
* [WebSocketSharp](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp) (included in `Assets/Plugins`)

### 2. Unity Project Setup

* Attach `CameraStreamer.cs` to your camera GameObject
* Attach `WebRtcServerManager.cs` to an empty GameObject in your scene
* Attach `WebSocketSignalingServer.cs` to the same or another GameObject
* Optionally add `SendButtonHandler.cs` and wire it to a button or input action

### 3. Run

* Build and run the Unity scene on a device (e.g., VR headset, mobile, or desktop)
* The app will open a WebSocket signaling server at `ws://<device-ip>:8080/ws`
* Connect a WebRTC-capable client to the server and initiate an SDP offer

## Example Message Formats

### WebRTC Offer (from client)

```json
{
  "type": "offer",
  "sdp": "v=0..."
}
```

### ICE Candidate (from client or Unity)

```json
{
  "type": "candidate",
  "candidate": "candidate:123...",
  "sdpMid": "0",
  "sdpMLineIndex": 0
}
```

### Answer (from Unity)

```json
{
  "type": "answer",
  "sdp": "v=0..."
}
```

## Notes

* **Buffering** is handled for data messages sent before the data channel is open
* Use `MainThreadDispatcher` for safely calling Unity methods from background threads
* Tested with Unity.WebRTC 3.0.0

---

## Use Cases

* Local-only WebRTC testing
* Streaming Unity camera feed to WebRTC-capable apps (desktop, mobile, VR)
* Prototyping peer-to-peer communication for training or therapy scenarios
* Mobile VR streaming using Google Cardboard + Unity
